# Pow CSS layout system

Pow is a powerful and super slim CSS layout system with progressive enhancement in mind. It is fully responsive and breakpoint free out of the box.

## The source code utilizes Sass

Pow is easy to setup, easy to use and very flexible. The core of Pow ships as vanilla CSS with prefix for the two latest versions of all browsers. You find the quickstart file in the `dist` folder.

But the recommendation is to customize Pow for your own needs through Sass, by adding your own Pow settings in your Sass source code. You can find all the default settings for Pow in the source file `src/pow.scss`.


### Customize the settings

```scss
// Pow column base size:
$pow-size: 400px;

// Pow margin around columns:
$pow-margin: 10px;
```

## What about the name?

Pow is powerful like an avalanche rampage in the mountains. It is nice to work with, just like skiing in fresh powder snow. Pow is like a pow pow day.
